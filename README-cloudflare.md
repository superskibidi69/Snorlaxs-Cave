# Cloudflare Pages Configuration

This project is now ready for deployment on Cloudflare Pages.

## Deployment Steps

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to Cloudflare Pages and create a new project, connecting your GitHub repo.
3. Set the build output directory to `static` (since your HTML files are in `static/`).
4. No build command is needed for a static site.
5. (Optional) Add a `_headers` or `_redirects` file in the `static/` folder for custom headers or redirects.

## Notes
- All static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images) are in the `static/` folder.
- You can move your main entry point (e.g., `index.html`) to the root of `static/` if needed.
- Cloudflare Pages will serve files from the output directory you specify.
